                <strong> My visit to Khatu Shyam temple!</strong>&nbsp;
</p><p></p><div>India is the mother to various castes, religions, and creeds. The phrase “Unity in Diversity” really does justice to the motherland of over 1 billion people. Of all I could speak about its glories and the people residing within it, I’d focus my attention on the grandeur of Rajasthan, where I visited last week and was reminded about true beauty in the face of it as I passed through the sandy dunes.
</div><div><br></div><div>The people of Rajasthan make their individual contributions to make it; the city of love. I guess the beauty of the state makes us want to come over and stay. Within it, lies the Temple of Lord Krishna: Khatu Shyam. The white colored temple is serene and reflects positivity all around it. It was of moderately size and was made by unusual Lime mortar, marble. The shutters of the temple were beautifully covered by a silver sheet. There is also a temple called Radhe Ki Haveli situated here. It is quite unique because of its special architecture. I had the good fortune of visiting both these places during the course of my visit.
</div><div><br></div><div>There were numerous guesthouses for the visitors. Most of their names revolved around the name of Krishna. On that special day, each guesthouse was full of devotees and all the people were busy in prayers. Speakers were on full volume which filled the atmosphere with energy. The setup was very uplifting.
</div><div><br></div><div>We arrived on the day of Ekadashi and the crowd was at its peak. Numbers didn't matter for anybody as everybody was busy in reciting prayers. As we reached closer to the temple a blanket of devoted energy surrounded us. The focal embodiment was of pure gold. It was hard to take our eyes off the epithet when it was visible to us.  
</div><div><br></div><div>The local people of Rajasthan were very kind-hearted and helpful. Local followers distributed the suppers, drinks, and other kinds of eatables to the people free of cost. Almost half the population comprised of local people and their energy everyday was never-ending. The ladies were justifying their traditional Rajasthani outfits which was an eye turner to the visitors. Their conversations among themselves in their Rajasthani language was enchanting and left us in a regional trance. The place was affordable even for the poor, the only requirement is devotion within one’s heart.
</div><div><br></div><div>Markets nearby the temples were bursting with attractive stuff hanging outside the shops. All the essential products for the worship of Lord Krishna were easily accessible. Shops were full of Rajasthani dresses, bangles, foot wears and many more striking accessories. The products were cheap and could easily purchased by the people. Narrow streets with decorated shops looked stunning. The overall beauty was more than gorgeous.
</div><div><br></div><div>Even though the trip was 2 days long it felt like a single joint moment. People who find themselves to be at peace with divinity and religious areas should consider visiting here around this time.</div><p></p></div>
